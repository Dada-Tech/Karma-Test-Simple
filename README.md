# Code Style
* Angular was chosen because of familiarity and to utilise Typescript.    
* Bootstrap 4 was used and SCSS for the rest   
* This layout is optimized for small devices too   
* an ordering 3rd party library to handle the logic for ordering products    
* The home home component was not necessary but added a "homepage" feel of a website which would display the products section from it      
* The logic for products is in the product component and the "server response" code is added there.   
* For the coloring, a tool to extract the exact HEX value of pixels was used  
* the exact height of the image and border was measured and replicated, along with the slight box shadow.  
* The arrows have a slight blue color to using css filtering  
* tests are included to demonstrate simple unit testing
